# MailChimp Tutorial

This is a guide for me how to setup a MailChimp account and run Email campaign from RSS feed of a WordPress site.

This is a very useful video tutorial on setting up a MailChimp edit campaign.

1. Click "Campaigns". Click "Create Campaign" button and click on "Create an Email".
2. In the resulting dialog box, there are 4 options. Choose "Automated" and under "Automated" tab choose "Featured" sub-tab and then click on "Share blog updates'.

I SHALL UPDATE THOROUGHLY LATER AS I LEARN MORE ABOUT IT.
